    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Get all the flavor of pizza without the hassle of making or buying pizza dough.
    You can split the buns in half along the fold to make appetizer-size portions, or you
    can leave the buns whole for mini-pizzas. These come together quickly, a bonus when time is short.
