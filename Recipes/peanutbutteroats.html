    <ol>
            <li><strong> Combine the base</strong>. In a mixing bowl, combine the oatmeal, chia seeds, and. milk. Stir well to combine. You can add the peanut butter and jelly here as well, or do the layers as you see below.</li>
            <li><strong>Layer.</strong> Add some of the base to four 8 oz mason jars (or use three larger jars), add a peanut butter and then jelly layer, and then add more of the base. OR, you can just add everything in one bowl. Just not as pretty</li>
